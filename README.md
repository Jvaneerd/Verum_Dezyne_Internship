# Verum_Dezyne_Internship
During my internship at Verum, I will be making a number of Dezyne applications for learning and teaching purposes. 
These can be found on this GitHub repository.

##### Short description of projects:
- Alarm_System: Alarm System tutorial found on [Verum's official site](http://www.verum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dezyne_Introductory-Tutorial.pdf)
- Living_Colours_Arduino: An Arduino project where a simple version of Philips' Living Colors light is recreated on the Arduino Uno platform. Complete with makefile that handles code generation and uploading to Arduino
- Living_Colours_RPi: The Living Colours application ported to C++ and targetting a Raspberry Pi as opposed to an Arduino. Also some minor Dezyne modeling improvements over Living_Colours_Arduino
